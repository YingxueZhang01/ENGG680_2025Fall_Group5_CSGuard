## Development Timeline & Migration Note
This repository contains the **final artifacts** of our project. The active development and training processes were conducted entirely within **Google Colab** and **Google Drive** due to the need for GPU resources (Tesla T4). 

As a result, the commit history in this repository reflects the **migration date** rather than the actual development timeline. The source code, trained weights (`best.pt`), and logs were exported from our Colab environment and uploaded here for submission and archiving purposes.

## Project Overview
This project implements an edge-optimized YOLOv8 object detection model designed to monitor Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) compliance on construction sites in real-time.

### Key Features
* **Model:** YOLOv8 Nano (optimized for edge devices).
* **Dataset:** Roboflow Construction Site Safety (>5,600 images).
* **Performance:** Achieved mAP@50 of 0.801.
* **Software:** Python backend with a custom-designed frontend interface.

## Repository Structure
* `/models`: The original Google Colab `.ipynb` source code and results containing the trained `best.pt` weights and confusion matrix.
* `/docs`: Presentation PPT and Speech scripts.
* `/apps`: Application source code (Backend logic & Frontend assets).
